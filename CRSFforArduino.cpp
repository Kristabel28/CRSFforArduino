/**
 * @par CRSF Protocol
 *
 * CRSF is a full duplex serial protocol. It is the bus protocol used by both TBS Crossfire & ExpressLRS receivers to
 * communicate with the flight controller.
 *
 * Each CRSF packet is sent to the flight controller at an interval of 4ms. The flight controller then responds with a
 * packet within every second packet sent by the receiver.
 *
 * The configuration of the serial port is 420000 baud, 8-bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit.
 * The entire protocol is big endian (MSB first).
 * The maximum packet size is 64 bytes.
 * The time needed per packet is 1.5ms.
 * A 64 byte packet plus a sync byte takes approximately 1.4ms to transmit.
 *
 * The protocol frame format is as follows:
 * <Device Address><Frame Length><Frame Type><Payload><CRC>
 *
 * The Device Address is a single byte that identifies the device that is receiving the frame.
 * The Frame Length is a single byte that indicates the length of the frame, including the Frame Type.
 * The Frame Type is a single byte that indicates the what type of frame was received.
 * The Payload is a variable length byte array that contains the data for the frame.
 * The CRC is a single byte that is the CRC-8-DVB-S2 of the entire frame, including the Device Address, Frame Length, and Frame
 * Type.
